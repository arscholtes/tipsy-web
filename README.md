# Tipsy Web
Tipsy is a simple tip calculator designed for use in a simple, hour-long crash
course on modern JavaScript development. The desktop version show cases the
following:

- modern JavaScript idioms through the use of ES2017 syntax
- modern programming paradigm through the use of subtle functional programming 
  techniques and Ramda
- modern UI frameworks through the use of React and MUI-CSS
- modern development work-flow through the use of webpack (including hot module
  reloading)


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
